## Lecture 1a

The data type, 5, is a(n) ________

* Integer 
* logical
* numeric
* complex

## Lecture 1b

Every data type is at least a ________

* vector
* matrix
* array
* factor 

## Lecture 2a

This statement assigns a list of weights(lbs) to a variable “w”

* w <-c(98,154, 140, 190, 173)
* w -> c(98,154, 140, 190, 173)
* w == c(98,154, 140, 190, 173)
* w is c(98,154, 140, 190, 173)

## Lecture 2b

In it’s most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator, complete the following statement with the appropriate characters in order to assign the variable, V, to have an end value of 36, given the expression: [(48 _ 42) _2]

* V<-(48-42)^2
* V->(48-42)^2
* V<-(48-42)*2
* V<-(48-42)%%2

## Lecture 3a

Add the strings together to form a coherent English statement and in correct R language:

A <- “?”
B <- “movie”
C <- “Have”
D <- “that” 
E <- “seen”
F <- “you”

* question<-c(C,F,E,D,B,A)
* question<- C+F+E+D+B+A
* question<-c(C+F+E+D+B+A)
* question<-c(A,B,C,D,E,F)

## Lecture 3b

Generate a sequence from 122 to 154 by intervals of 2.

seq(122,154,2)
seq(154,122,2)
seq(122,2,154)
seq(2,154,122)

## Lecture 4a

Create a normal distribution curve centering on 10, with spread 0 to 20. 

* n<-20
k<-0:n
paths<-choose(n,k)
plot(k,paths, sum(paths))

* n<-10
k<-0:n
paths<-choose(n,k)
plot(k,paths, sum(paths))

* n<-20
k<-0:n
paths<-choose(k,n)
plot(k,paths, sum(paths))

* n<-10
k<-0:n
paths<-choose(k,n)
plot(k,paths, sum(paths))

## Lecture 4b

Create a rectangular matrix with 16 entries of numbers 1 through 16. The matrix should have 4 rows and have the numbers increasing across each row. What would this command look like in R? 

* matrix(1:16, byrow=TRUE, nrow=4)
* matrix(1:16)
* matrix(1:16, byrow =FALSE)
* matrix(1:16, byrow = TRUE, nrow=2) 

## Lecture 5a

Body Mass Index is a measure of body fat based on height(m) and weight(kg) that applies to adult men and women, one matrix holds each patient’s height(“HEIGHT”), while a second matrix holds each patient’s weight(“WEIGHT”). Knowing that BMI = Weight(kg)/Height^2(m^2), what function in R would produce a table of BMI for each respective patient? 

* BMI<-WEIGHT/HEIGHT^2
* BMI <-HEIGHT/WEIGHT^2
* It cannot be performed

## Lecture 5b

There is a dataset called CDC, within the dataset there are columns representing patient name, age,  height, and weight – What R command allows the selection of all entries within the weight category:

* CDC$weight
* Weight$CDC
* CDC(weight)
* Wight(CDC)


## Lecture 6a

Read.table loads a text file into a data frame. True or False?

* True
* False 

## Lecture 6b

The function head() does this:

* enables you to show the first observations of a data frame(or any R object you pass to it)
* creates a header in the data frame
* summarizes the data in a table

## Lecture 7a

## Lecture 7b
